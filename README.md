# Embedded Visual Studio Code Hello World samples

This repository's purpose is to share various embedded hello world samples with debugging experience as the top priority.
I myself am a beginner in embedded programming and I find it hard to find simple samples that are not tied to proprietary Eclipse based IDEs.

VS Code is an awesome open source text editor and in my opinion this is much easier to understand how is the embedded world working by editing configuration files rather than going into some shady menu settings deep down in your IDE...

I'm paying an extra attention to debugging here because being able to debug a program is for me a must-have feature.

As a final note, there's not much for the moment.
I'm using it for myself so I can always come here and check how I did successfully debug in a way or another.
I'm planning, in a rather near future, to explore debugging with the Zephyr RTOS as well as RISC-V microcontrollers.
